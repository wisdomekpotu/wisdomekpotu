## Hey There ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Wisdom Ekpotu ðŸ¤–

  I'm a Third Year Student majoring in Computer Engineering @ University of Uyo, Nigeria. I am a Mern Stack developer, an open-source advocate and a Community Builder. 

   Apart from my technical abilities,I lead developer communities on campus. I am also currently building and growing the biggest developer community on my campus with over 500+ active student developers.I am the Google Developer Student Clubs Lead for my campus and I just recently conducted a technical workshop where we helped various students especially freshman and sophomore students get started with coding, open source and software development.

I also love working with the developer communities on a global scale, building cool demo's, writing technical articles, speaking at conferences.

ðŸ¥‚ Cheers!
